# Titanic Data Analysis

![alt text](portada.jpeg)

## Introduction
The sinking of the RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912, is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history, 
resulting in the loss of over 1,500 lives. This notebook aims to analyze the Titanic dataset to uncover insights into the 
factors that influenced passenger survival. Through data visualization and statistical analysis,
we will explore the relationships between various variables, such as age, fare, and class, to understand the 
underlying patterns and correlations within the data.

## Repository Structure

- **EDA_Visualization_Titanic.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the step-by-step analysis of the Titanic dataset.
- **functions.py**: A Python script with helper functions used in the analysis.
- **data/**: Directory containing the Titanic dataset and any other relevant data files.

## Analysis Highlights

### Data Preparation
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and correcting data types.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and converting categorical variables to numeric format using one-hot encoding.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing the main characteristics of the dataset.
- **Visualization**: Using plots to explore the distribution and relationships of variables.

### Correlation Matrices
- **Numeric Conversion**: Converting categorical variables like `Sex` and `Embarked` into numeric format.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Computing and visualizing the correlation matrix to understand the relationships between different variables.

### Trios Analysis
- **Detailed Examination**: Analyzing the interactions between multiple variables to uncover intricate patterns and correlations.
- **Group Insights**: Identifying significant groups within the dataset, such as males in third class traveling alone who did not survive.

## Key Findings
- The analysis reveals critical insights into the factors that influenced survival rates, such as gender, class, and family size.
- A significant social group was identified: males in third class traveling alone who did not survive.
- The framework used in this analysis is highly customizable, allowing for flexible and versatile exploration of different aspects of the data.
